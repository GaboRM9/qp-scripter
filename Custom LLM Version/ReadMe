QxScripter - RAG version

QxScripter is a custom model specifically trained to support QuestionPro personal 
when creating custom made scripts for JS logics.

On this time we are going to use some of the following tools:

1 - Python
2 - Ollama Model: OllamaCode - Meta's open-source code interpreter model.
3 - OpenAI or any Open - source emmbeding conversor.
4 - Github repository containing knowledge files (data should be clean).
5 - LangChain - Text spliting, data processing.
6 - Vector DB and libraries for manipulation.

*by clean I mean to standarize and format the data the best way possible before generate the emmbedings.

The flow:

Update clean data to a git repo.

    We need to set a git hub repository to use as knowledge on the python script, this repository should only contain relevant files.

Read and split documents using LangChain.

    We will use LangChain to pre-process the data before the emmbedings.

Create emmbedings and upload to db.

RAG.
