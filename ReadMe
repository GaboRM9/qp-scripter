Documented process to generate a custom GPT that helps the users generate scripts for JS logics.

Step 1: Gather Data 


geturls.py: Gets all the URLs present on a website and saves them on a CSV.
getcontent.py: Gets all the text content of a csv of URLs.
examples.js: This file contains a library of custom scripts.
kb_qpscripting.txt: This file contains all the text content of all of the URLS extracted on geturls.py & getcontent.py

Step 2: Clean & Clasify 

Used python + regex to clean the data.

doclean.py: Translates the code comments (Original in spanish)

Step 3: Feed GPT

There are 3 ways of doing this:

1 - Directly uploading the files to a customGPT. (Currently active)
2 - Create an assistant to have an API endpoint. (Not accurate)
3 - Retrieval-Augmented Generation.
